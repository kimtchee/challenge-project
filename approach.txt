- Figure out infrastructure
    - Flask application with PG database (deploy)
    - Dockerize (if time): allows us to run application/server anywhere locally
- Decide PG db schema
    - Deleted records go to a different table
    - Version with an integer
    - Separate table for GUIDs



Notes;
- SCHEMA in postres - namespace that contains named database objects
    - To access an object in a schema, you need to qualify the object by using the following syntax: schema_name.object_name
